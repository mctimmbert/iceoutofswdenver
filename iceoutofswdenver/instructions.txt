Home Page: one page that scrolls with sections    

it should be immediately clear who we are, like a banner or something that says, “ice out of sw denver”   then uynder that it should say, “neighbor led organizing, training, resources, and mutual aid for southwest denver”. 

additional pages that you can navigate at the top tabs or toolbar or whatever its called. these should be “resources”   “events”  “get connected”  


or maybe the view resources and get connected should be links on the home  page that then take 

you to a different page. the get connected page should be a way to get to signal 




✅ Best structure: “Get Connected” → a simple choice page

When someone clicks Get Connected, they should land on a page that says:

Choose how you want to connect (no full name required):

With 3 clear options:


🟢 Option 1: Join the Signal group (invite-only)

Button text:
Request a Signal Invite

This links to a very short form (NOT the Signal link directly).

Minimal form fields (no full name required):

First name or nickname (optional)

Preferred language (EN / ES)

Neighborhood or cross streets (optional)
