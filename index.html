          <h2>Neighbor-led organizing, training, resources, and mutual aid for southwest denver</h2>
          <p>
           ICE Out of Southwest Denver is a neighbor-led organizing effort committed to defending the dignity, safety, and rights of migrants in our community. We believe no one should live in fear of sudden detention, family separation, or intimidation carried out through inhumane and unlawful enforcement practices. Our work is rooted in solidarity, non-violence, and respect for the rule of law.</p>
          <p>We organize regular meetings to plan outreach, share accurate information, and coordinate support. Neighbors canvass their blocks, distribute flyers and know-your-rights materials, and help hand out Red Cards so people can assert their constitutional rights during ICE encounters. We also connect families to legal, housing, and emergency resources and train volunteers in safe, lawful ways to observe and respond to ICE activity.</p>

          <p>Southwest Denver is made up of many distinct neighborhoods, each with its own history and community networks. This map highlights the neighborhoods where our organizing, outreach, and support efforts are active. Grounding this work locally helps neighbors connect with one another, coordinate effectively, and make sure information and resources reach the people who need them most.</p>
          <h2>Get Involved</h2>
          <p>Resistance does not mean violence. It means showing up, sharing knowledge, and protecting one another. If you live in Southwest Denver and believe in human dignity and community safety, we invite you to join us—by attending an organizing meeting, helping with canvassing, or supporting mutual aid efforts. Visit our Events page to see upcoming meetings, and our Resources page to find know-your-rights information and support services.</p>
